## Description
For this Week 9 Challenge we were tasked with creating a README generator with node.js that we can use for future repo's/projects!

## Installation
For installation instructions please visit my github repo https://github.com/joshbaileydev513/readme-generator to clone and review the README provided.

## Usage
To use this project, please make sure you have inquirer installed. Once that is installed, the user can run invoke it via the gitbash terminal by node index.js . The user will then be prompted with questions that make a high quality README. Once all questions are answered, the README is generated for the user in the develop folder.
